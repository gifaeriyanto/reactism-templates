# Next.js Starter

This is my boilerplate for my next.js project. _Don't take too long to get started!_.

## Features

#### ✅ Typescript

#### ✅ Path alias resolved
This feature actually needs improvement, still using manual configuration on tsconfig, webpack and jest

#### ✅ PWA
This config is run well when we using serverless with now. Need custom for custom server.

#### ✅ Serverless with [now](https://github.com/zeit/now "now")

#### ✅ Test with [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/ "Testing Library")

#### ✅ Start with perfect audit
